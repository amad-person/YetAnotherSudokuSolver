# Yet Another Sudoku Solver

An attempt to solve our friendly neighbourhood Suduko puzzle using constraint satisfaction problem solving techniques.

#### Techniques used:
1. Constraint Propagation
2. Backtracking search with:
    * Variable Ordering: Minimum-Remaining-Values
    * Value Ordering (to be added)
    
Adapted from Peter Norvig's article on solving Sudoku puzzles.

#### What I learned:
* Implementing a cool CSP problem.
* Using OOP techniques (well?).
* Using Java was not a great choice for this problem.
