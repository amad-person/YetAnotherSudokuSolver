#yet-another-sudoku-solver

An attempt to solve our friendly neighbourhood Suduko puzzle using constraint satisfaction problem solving techniques.

####Techniques used:
1. Constraint Propagation
2. Backtracking search with:
    - Variable Ordering: Minimum-Remaining-Values
    - Value Ordering (to be added)
    
Adapted from Peter Norvig's article on solving Sudoku puzzles.

####What I learned
* Implementing a cool CSP problem
* Used OOP techniques (well?)
* Using Java was not a great choice for this problem
